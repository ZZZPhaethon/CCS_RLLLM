"""Resolve the current timestep's effective values after disturbances.

This module does not generate disturbance scenarios. It is the lookup layer used
after a :class:`Scenario` has written the current step's disturbance values into
:class:`PhysicalState`.

The physical entities (:class:`Emitter`, :class:`InjectionWell`, ...) store
nominal values. These helpers return the effective values for the current step:
use the value on :class:`PhysicalState` when a disturbance override exists,
otherwise fall back to the entity's nominal value.
